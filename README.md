# **Heart Failure Analysis and Prediction**

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death globally with taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year. More than four out of five CVD deaths are due to heart attacks and one third of these deaths occur prematurely in people under 70 yearsÂ of age. Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs. Early detection and management wherein a machine learning model can be of great help.

**Objective**
- What factors affect heart failure?
- What is the best machine learning algorithm model to predict heart failure?

**Conclusion**
- All features in the dataset are used to analysing (no redundant features)
- Individual's Old peak is the highest factor that cause heart disease and affects heart failure
- Logistic regression is the best model due to higher recall score than Random forest

**Recommendation**
Adding more features about  lifestyle. Example:
- Smoker status
- Daily food
