# **Heart Failure Analysis and Prediction with Logistic Regression**

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death globally with taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year. More than four out of five CVD deaths are due to heart attacks and one third of these deaths occur prematurely in people under 70 years of age. Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs. Early detection and management wherein a machine learning model can be of great help.

**Conclusion**
- All features in the dataset are used to analysing (no redundant features)
- Individual's Old peak is the highest factor that cause heart disease and affects heart failure
- Logistic regression model is capable to used due to high accuracy and precision

**Recommendation**
Adding more features about  lifestyle. Example:
- Smoker status
- Daily food
